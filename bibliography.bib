abstract = {At first glance, the positive correlation of chocolate consumption per capita and the accumulated number of Nobel laureates per capita, as reported by Messerli (2012), seems spurious. The intention of this paper is to check whether this correlation vanishes if relevant covariates and a sophisticated estimation method are employed. A two-stage Heckman selection model is estimated where the stock of Nobel laureates per capita is regressed on chocolate consumption per capita, as well as the number of published scientific papers, R & D expenditures per capita and GDP per capita. In addition, coffee and tobacco consumption per capita are also included. In contrast to the expectation, it is found that a positive correlation between chocolate consumption per capita and the stock of Nobel laureates per capita persists although more recent data and relevant covariates, as well as a sophisticated estimation method are used. In addition, a further negative correlation between coffee consumption per capita and the number of Nobel laureates per capita is detected. Albeit no clear causal relationship between winning a Nobel prize and chocolate or coffee consumption seems to exists, it remains unclear whether the effects are caused by hidden variables or by chance. However, the results are limited due to the lack of individual consumption data.}

There are several constraint-based causal search algorithms (e.g \textitRFCI, \emphFCI, or \emphFCI+) that are asymptotically correct without assuming that there are no unmeasured confounders, but often perform poorly on small samples. We describe a combined score and constraint-based algorithm, \emphGFCI, that we prove is asymptotically correct. On synthetic data, \textitGFCI is only slightly slower than \emphRFCI but more accurate than \textitFCI, \textitRFCI and \textitFCI+.}

We study the inherent tradeoffs in learning classifiers with a fairness constraint in the form of two questions: what is the best accuracy we can expect for a given level of fairness?, and what is the nature of these optimal fairness-aware classifiers? To answer these questions, we provide three main contributions. First, we relate two existing fairness measures to cost-sensitive risks. Second, we show that for such cost-sensitive fairness measures, the optimal classifier is an instance-dependent thresholding of the class-probability function. Third, we relate the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness to the alignment between the target and sensitive features’ class-probabilities. A practical implication of our analysis is a simple approach to the fairness-aware problem which involves suitably thresholding class-probability estimates.}

As such, understanding the capabilities and limitations of such models is becoming critical. However, the abilities of these models are typically measured using automated metrics that often only reveal a portion of their real-world performance. While, in general, the performance of NCMs appears promising, currently much is unknown about how such models arrive at decisions. To this end, this paper introduces do${}_{\textbf{code}}$code , a post hoc interpretability method specific to NCMs that is capable of explaining model predictions. do${}_{\textbf{code}}$code is based upon causal inference to enable programming language-oriented explanations. While the theoretical underpinnings of do${}_{\textbf{code}}$code are extensible to exploring different model properties, we provide a concrete instantiation that aims to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations by grounding explanations of model behavior in properties of programming languages. To demonstrate the practical benefit of do${}_{\textbf{code}}$code , we illustrate the insights that our framework can provide by performing a case study on two popular deep learning architectures and ten NCMs. The results of this case study illustrate that our studied NCMs are sensitive to changes in code syntax. All our NCMs, except for the BERT-like model, statistically learn to predict tokens related to blocks of code (e.g., brackets, parenthesis, semicolon) with less confounding bias as compared to other programming language constructs. These insights demonstrate the potential of do${}_{\textbf{code}}$code as a useful method to detect and facilitate the elimination of confounding bias in NCMs.},

abstract="Registered reports are scientific publications which begin the publication process by first having the detailed research protocol, including key research questions, reviewed and approved by peers. Subsequent analysis and results are published with minimal additional review, even if there was no clear support for the underlying hypothesis, as long as the approved protocol is followed. Registered reports can prevent several questionable research practices and give early feedback on research designs. In software engineering research, registered reports were first introduced in the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) in 2020. They are now established in three conferences and two pre-eminent journals, including this one (EMSE). We explain the motivation for registered reports, outline the way they have been implemented in software engineering, and outline some ongoing challenges for addressing high quality software engineering research.",

abstract = {We consider estimation of a total causal effect from observational data via covariate adjustment. Ideally, adjustment sets are selected based on a given causal graph, reflecting knowledge of the underlying causal structure. Valid adjustment sets are, however, not unique. Recent research has introduced a graphical criterion for an 'optimal' valid adjustment set (O-set). For a given graph, adjustment by the O-set yields the smallest asymptotic variance compared to other adjustment sets in certain parametric and non-parametric models. In this paper, we provide three new results on the O-set. First, we give a novel, more intuitive graphical characterisation: We show that the O-set is the parent set of the outcome node(s) in a suitable latent projection graph, which we call the forbidden projection. An important property is that the forbidden projection preserves all information relevant to total causal effect estimation via covariate adjustment, making it a useful methodological tool in its own right. Second, we extend the existing IDA algorithm to use the O-set, and argue that the algorithm remains semi-local. This is implemented in the R-package pcalg. Third, we present assumptions under which the O-set can be viewed as the target set of popular non-graphical variable selection algorithms such as stepwise backward selection.},
